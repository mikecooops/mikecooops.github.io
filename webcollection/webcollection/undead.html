	<div class="undeadtext">Essentially this figure equates to a twilight<br> ringwraith, that is how a wraith would appear<br> while wearing the ring. This specific model is<br> actually the foe which stabbed Frodo in the<br> first film. He shimmers in the light and is<br> carrying both a long sword and poison<br> dagger, each which can be held by the figure.</div>
