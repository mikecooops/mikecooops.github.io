	<div class="smeagoltext">Yes, Smeagol or “Gollum” as most might call<br> him was actually once a hobbit like Frodo<br> and Bilbo! In my own opinion, this figure looks<br> just as decrepit and insane as the on screen<br> Smeagol. Unfortunately his left hand is missing<br> (probably chopped off by another action figure).</div>
