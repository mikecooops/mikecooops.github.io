	<div class="infantrytext">This standard infantry elf is more common in<br> the Hobbit trilogy, however it stands as one<br> of the more decorative pieces. Unlike most elf<br> action figures, this one comes with both sword<br> and shield, without a bow and arrow. The<br> intricate armor engravings certainly separate<br> this figurine from the rest.  </div>
