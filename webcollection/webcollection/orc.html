	<div class="orctext">The beast rider orc action figure is the prize<br> of the collection. Although heâ€™s missing both<br> hands from combat (aka natural wear and<br> tear) and his war dog, this action figure is<br> actually quite detailed. He carries a crude<br> looking dagger which also happens to be<br> missing. The war dog had a movable jaw<br> which could be motioned by a button on its<br> left side.</div>
