  <h1>Eat: Venice</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>"Sarde in saor"</h2>
  <p>Although considered to be an appetizer or as the italians say "antipasto",<br> this dish is rich in flavor and will certainly fill up the hungry traveler who<br> is willing to expand his/ her pallet. Essentially, the plate is lined with<br> sardine fillets marinated in vinegar, onions, raisins and pine nuts.</p>

  <h2>"Risotto al nero di seppia"</h2>
  <p>With rice being a staple in the region, it makes sense to include a dish<br> that confirms just that. Because Venice is also known as the "city on water",<br> many of the native dishes include some form of sea life. The risotto's color<br> comes from squid, wine, onion, tomato and ink braise.</p>

  <h2>"Fritole"</h2>
  <p>These sweet pastry fritters are commonly eaten during the <a href="partyvenice.html">"Carnevale" period</a>,<br> a masquerade festival and party you wouldn't want to miss. "Fritoles" are made<br> with a batter consisting of flour, eggs, butter, milk, sugar, pine nuts and raisins.<br> They are then are molded into balls and deep fried in oil and dusted with a light<br> coat of sugar. </p>
