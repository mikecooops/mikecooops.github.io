  <h2>"Bistecca alla Fiorentina"</h2>
  <p>The name literally translates to "Florentine steak", however don't be<br> fooled by its familiar sounding American counterpart. This steak is<br> cooked one way: seared on outside and rare on the inside. It is often<br> seasoned with salt, pepper, a hint of lemon and cooked over roasted<br> chestnuts for a smokiness.</p>

  <h2>"Papardelle al Cinghiale"</h2>
  <p>This is a dish made with long, wide, flat pasta and meat. "Cinghiale"<br> translates to wild boar, however the dish is often made with other<br> meats such as rabbit. The sauce tends to be on the heavier side so<br> you can expect it to be quite filling!</p>

  <h2>"Lampredotto"</h2>
  <p>A common folk food stemming from Florence's medieval age, the<br> "lampredotto" can either be served as a sandwich or on a plate. If<br> it's in sandwich form, it's filled with thinly sliced tripe, or intestines.<br> Have no fear because these intestines have been been both boiled<br> and seasoned. You also have the choice of either red or green sauce.</p>
